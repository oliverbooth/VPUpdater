# VPUpdater

This tool is directly inspired by [VPUpdater](https://github.com/Evonex/VPUpdater) by Evonex. However since its last commit 4 years prior, a lot has changed and there were a lot of issues.

* The tool did not support the 64-bit version of Virtual Paradise.
* The original dev committed build output and binaries to SCM.
* 
* It was written in VB.NET (this isn't necessarily bad, but C# is more properly supported by the community.)
